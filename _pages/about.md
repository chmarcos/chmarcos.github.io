I am a specialist in Genomic Sciences, I have guided myself to acquire skills in experimental work and bioinformatics on interesting topics learning from admirable people. Iâ€™m interested in the analysis of omics data to discover novel gene targets and to understand the mechanism of action of new drugs in cancer. I implement my analyses in reproducible workflows and graphic interfaces. 

I am really motivated to participate in new challenging projects, to achieve my goals, I work hard and independently.
