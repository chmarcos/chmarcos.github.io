Work experience
======
* Undergrad research assistant at Alejandro Sanchez's Lab
  * FEB 2020 - PRESENT
   
     Advisor: Fidel Alejandro Sánchez \| Sequencing and Bioinformatics Unit, Institute of Biotechnology UNAM, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.
      <div style="text-align: justify">
     I worked in the regulatory profile of prostate cancer cell line under AZD5363 treatment. I worked with RNA seq data and I carried out the enrichment analysis, Cytoscape interaction network and transcription factor activity analysis. I used R and R Markdown to create an automated report that is reproducible and applicable in other projects.
